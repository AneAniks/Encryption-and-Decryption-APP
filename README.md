# Encryption-and-Decryption-APP
### University Project ( Second year of studies ) 

Our project is multi-platform based application that works in Java, Android and Pascal. 

### Sign up Form!
The Sign up Form contains multiple fields where 
the users will use their personal details to create 
account in the database. In this form we have:

	•Name
	•Surname
	•Email
	•Password 
With query the information provided
in this form are added to the project database.

### Login Form!
The Login Form contains two fields:

	•Email
	•Password
We use this form to check into the database for
existing and corresponding fields for the
login process.
If the user does not have valid account, (s)he
can register trough the Sign up form.

We made SQL query that collect the login data and stores it in our database, 
the whole point of this query is to have information what platform the users are using whether Android or Lazarus. 

### Main Form!
Besides the sing up and login process we have designed a special form for Encryption and Decryption trough 
the Caesar Cipher Algorithm.

In the main form we have multiple fields:

	•Key (where the user inputs their wanted key for encryption and decryption)

	•Plain text (Where the users inputs the plain text)

	•Encrypted box (where we get the encrypted data)

	•Decryption box (where we get the decrypted data)
